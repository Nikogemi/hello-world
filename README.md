# hello-world
Hello, I am Nicholas, also known as Niko.
Suffice it to say i am absurdly new to the world of coding.
However I find it very interesting, want to learn as much as i possibly can, and I feel that my journey as security in the nightclub/bar industry is nearing completion.
At present I live in San Francisco, was originally born in this city, however I was raised on the Southside of the Chicagoland area.
I love to sing, dance, overthink things, and talk a lot.
Though, admittedly, I'm never sure how to talk about myself in things such as this.
I suppose what brought me to the conclusion that obtaining a tech based skillset would be beneficial to me is my history playing video games, coupled with how much these things have become interwoven into everday society, and my living in San Francisco.
I'm positive about this new chapter in "The Book of Niko".
I happen to like new experiences as well as people, regardless of if it ends up a positive or negative.
Life lessons are just that, lessons from life, and knowledge is power.
So in the words of a moderately iconic man, "Let's get it on" - Mills Lane.
