# hello-world
Hello, I am Nicholas, also known as Niko. Suffice it to say i am absurdly new to the world of coding. However I find it very interesting, want to learn as much as i possibly can, and am just plain tired of being in security in the nightclub/bar industry. I live in San Francisco, love to sing, and talk a lot. Though, admittedly, I'm never sure how to talk about myself in things such as this. I'm positive about this new chapter in "The Book of Niko". I happen to like new experiences as well as people, regardless of if it ends up a positive or negative. "Let's get it on" - Mills Lane.
