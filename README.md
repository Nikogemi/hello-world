# hello-world
Hello, I am Nicholas, also known as Niko. Suffice it to say i am absurdly new to the world of coding.
However I find it very interesting, want to learn as much as i possibly can, and am just plain tired of being security in the nightclub/bar industry.
Truth told, it's mind numbing and not exactly a livable wage.
At present I live in San Francisco, I was actually born here, though I was raised in the Chicagoland area about half of my life.
I love to sing, dance, overthink things, and talk a lot.
Though, admittedly, I'm never sure how to talk about myself in things such as this.
I'm positive about this new chapter in "The Book of Niko".
I happen to like new experiences as well as people, regardless of if it ends up a positive or negative.
